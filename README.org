** instructions

- edit ~check.config~ to contain your desired checks
- edit ~notify.config~ to contain your desired notifications
- run ~nomd~

** protocol

*** checks

Checks write one or more lines to stdout in the format

: SEVERITY:CHECK:INFORMATION

where

- SEVERITY :: is one of ~C~ (critical), ~W~ (warning) or ~I~ (informational - quite verbose, also used for debugging)
- CHECK :: is the name of the check that wrote the line
- INFORMATION :: is freetext information about the details of the check

*** notifications

A notification is called with the environment variable
~NOMD_CHECK_RESULTS~ pointing to a file with the complete results of
the preceding checks.  See [[checks]] for the file format description.

** things for thoughts

- configuration
  - simple configurations can be done directly, but what about
    - lists
    - even more complicated things
  - for example diskfree plugin
    - skip some mounts
    - change warning thresholds for others
  - central configuration file?
  - per module configuration file?
- convenience function for writing the protocol lines that
  automatically detects the name of the current check
- switch README from Org to Markdown?
  - Org is cooler, but the Github rendering is slightly sucky
