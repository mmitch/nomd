** protocol

Checks write one or more lines to stdout in the format

: SEVERITY:CHECK:INFORMATION

where

- /SEVERITY/ :: is one 
  - ~C~ :: critical
  - ~W~ :: warning
  - ~I~ :: informational (quite verbose, also used for debug)
- /CHECK/ :: is the name of the check that wrote the line
- /INFORMATION/ :: is freetext information about the details of the check

** things for thoughts

- configuration
  - simple configurations can be done directly, but what about
    - lists
    - even more complicated things
  - for example diskfree plugin
    - skip some mounts
    - change warning thresholds for others
  - central configuration file?
  - per module configuration file?
- convenience function for writing the protocol lines that
  automatically detects the name of the current check
